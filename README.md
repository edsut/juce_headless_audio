# juce_headless_audio
Recently I had to help a colleague convert a JUCE application that had a GUI and audio 
interface into one that could run on a Linux server (headless... no Desktop).
That turned out to be not quite as trivial as I suspected, so I put a simple example
here for anyone that may run into the same problem.
Note that I am not an experience JUCE programmer, so the style/method used here may
be ugly; but it works.
